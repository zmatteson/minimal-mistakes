Quick update on my life:  school started up, and now my free time has dwindled down to basically nothing.  Between coding, work, school, I could spend all my free time doing something productive, and I would still probably feel like I was missing out on something.

Usually, in these moments in the past, I've gotten overly enthusiastic and then prematurely burned out, immediately after the 3 books I ordered on Amazon showed up.  Realizing this about myself is different than actually changing my behavior - instead, sometimes I feel like I'm on a rollercoaster ride that ends with me watching youtube videos in my bed, ordering pizza, and not leaving the house all weekend.  

To avoid this, I want to try to trick my brain into forming good, sustainable habits.  So, I'm going to identify a few key areas in terms of priorities:

1) School
2) Work
3) Free time 
    * LeetCode
    * Study of algorithms/general compsci knowledge
    * Projects
        * This blog
        * Tensorflow stuff (i.e. Choose your own appventure)
        * Kaggle? (This probably will fall under the school category)

My goal is to puth the work and research I do in my freetime onto GitHub. So, I'm starting a [repo](https://github.com/zmatteson/leetcode) to hold my LeetCode solutions, and I think this is going to help motivate me to keep working on this project on a regular basis.  It feels good to build something, even if it's just a collection of python scripts. I'll probably add a few repos in the future, regarding interview prep, math homework, etc, if I compile anything interesting.
