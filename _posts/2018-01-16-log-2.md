tODAY IN 

It turns out it takes a long time to train a neural network.  My desktop CPU isn't GPU accelerated, and the script ran for upwards of 7 hours before completing.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to save the results, because I didn't pipe any of the output to a file, but suffice to say the results were not great.  

The script was training on Nietzsche, however, so let's see what happens when I train the network on 3-5th grade Choose Your Own Adventure material.  

Currently, tonight I'm spending time scrubbing data to train my new network.  This is a process I won't describe in great detail, because I want to keep my data private, but suffice to say that all the script wants is a large text file.  It's recommended to have 100k to 1 Million characters.  We'll experiment some.  My data size is around 500k characters, mostly unedited.  We can run the script overnight and see what results we get in the morning.
