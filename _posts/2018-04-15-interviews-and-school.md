Status update:  I'm finishing school at the end of the month!  My personal project, CYOA, is currently on hold until I graduate.  So what have I been up to in the meantime?  Interview prep and school projects.

I've had a couple interview opportunites come my way, specifically the Engineering Residency program at Google, and a more general Software Engineering job at Home Depot.   I'll have an update in a few weeks with more specifics, but I did want to write about the interview prep I've been doing.  I find technical interviews to be really intimidating, but I developed a system that helped me improve dramatically.

Zeb's Interview Prep Methods:

1) 1 Leetcode problem a day (actually, I've been slacking on this one for the past couple weeks)
2) As many problems from Elements of Programming Interviews in Python (Aziz, et alia) as I can in a day
3) Review and implement algorithms and data structures from Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)
4) Listen to the MIT OpenCourseWare Intro to Algorithms (6.006) lectures on YouTube during my daily commute
5) Practice interviews with friends and online at interviewing.io (every 2 weeks or so)
 
Additionally, I've read a few articles, checked out some helpful github repos, and worked through a few Cracking the Coding Interview problems.  But I found that sticking to my daily routine was the most effective way for me to oberve real progress.  Looking back, one of the most helpful things I started doing was not looking at any coding challenge answers unless I was really stuck.  Generally, if I'm super stuck, I'll take a day off and go back to it - and then if I still don't get it, I'll read about a solution.  Then I'll implement that solution in my own way, reconstructing it from my own understanding (I see this as coding with training wheels).  The more I do this, the less I found myself getting stuck.  

Generally, as I work through harder problems and start new topics, I definitely find myself spending more time than I want floundering for an answer.  However, I've started enjoying the process of being stuck.  As a person who is impatient and doesn't like working harder than I need to, this is the equivalent of starting to enjoy exercise.  Sometimes it's hard to get into the mindset, but once I'm deep in a problem, it's fun.

Additionally, the practice interviews were huge helps.  I have had a great experience with interviewing.io so far - my interviewers have been able to help me highlight the gaps in my ability.  I would say that I need to improve across all areas: technical ability, problem solving, and communication - but my current bottleneck is technical ability.  My coding chops just aren't strong enough.  After I finish school, I plan to spend extra time working on improving my Python skill and finesse.

I've put a lot of my code from these practice problems on Github.  A lot of it is terrible, and I want to go back and rewrite it, but I want to keep it as a snapshot of my ability and understanding at this time, like saving your childhood drawings or stories for posterity.  I don't think I'm a good coder, or even good problem solver - but I'm happy that I've been making incremental, occasionally frustratingly slow, progress.

I want to keep exercising this skill throughout my life to keep improving my algorithm chops, like playing scales on the guitar or piano.  It's interesting to me to see how many paralells I find between music, math, writing, and coding.  No matter the subject, skill dramatically improves with practice.  I don't think anyone needs to be gifted at any of these things.

I have been amazed, however, by how much time I can sink into interview prep. If I wanted, it could be an all day event.  It's hard to regulate your time and stay on track - honestly, the older I get, the more I realize how important discipline and time management is when it comes to preparation.  Sometimes, it's really important to let go, and realize that not everything can be perfect.  I think I'm very good at this regarding cooking - it was a daily battle to make sure you had your bases covered every day before service started.  Extending it to other parts of my life is more challenging (partly because there is no angry Chef wondering why I ran out of diced potatoes less than an hour into my shift), but incredibly an incredibly important skill to master.

Speaking of time management - I actually need to wrap this post up.  I still need to write about my school projects, but that will have to wait for a different day.
